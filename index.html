                                With more than 20 years of experience building and using transportation demand models,
                                Jeff has had plenty of time to make a lot of mistakes. But also he's had time to learn from
                                them, and to fix a few. ChatGPT thinks he has a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University
                                of California, but that's just not true (it's from Northwestern).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You may have heard that one is the loneliest number, but that doesn't always need to be the
                                case.  Although Jeff is the only employee of Driftless Labs, he rarely works alone, as
                                it's inefficient and boring, and who wants that? Pretty much every project listed below
                                is a collaboration with others.

                        We're located high up on Eagles Bluff, overlooking the confluence of the
                        Root and Mississippi Rivers, in the heart of what is known as the Driftless Area.
                        It's a geological marvel, a small area of the Upper Mississippi
                        River Basin that escaped the glacial activity that flattened much
                        of the rest of the Midwest during the last Ice Age. As a result,
                        the Driftless Area boasts a captivating and unique topography,
                        characterized by undulating hills, deep valleys, and dramatic
                        limestone bluffs.
                    </p><p>
                        The absence of glacial drift, the mixture of sediments left behind
                        by glaciers, allows the underlying rock formations to take center
                        stage. Ancient limestone and sandstone formations, sculpted by
                        the erosive forces of wind and water over millennia, create a
                        landscape that is both rugged and visually striking. Numerous
                        meandering rivers have carved out deep valleys as they flow down
                        to join the mighty Mississippi, which flows right through the middle
                        of the Driftless.
